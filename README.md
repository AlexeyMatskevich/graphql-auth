# GraphQL Auth

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/graphql-auth`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphql-auth'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install graphql-auth
    
Then run the installer to create `graphql_auth.rb` file in your initializers folder.

```
rails g graphql_auth:install
```

Make sure to read all configurations present inside the file and fill them with your own configs.

## Devise gem

Use Devise with a User model and skip all route

```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  devise_for :users, skip: :all
end
```

## Usage

Make 'JWT_SECRET_KEY' and 'APP_URL' available to ENV

```
JWT_SECRET_KEY=
APP_URL=
```

Make sure the `Authorization` header is allowed in your api

```
Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
  allow do
    origins '*'
    resource '*',
             headers: %w(Authorization),
             methods: :any,
             expose: %w(Authorization),
             max_age: 600
  end
end
``` 

Make sure to include `Graphql::AuthHelper` in your `GraphqlController`. A context method returning the current_user will be available

```
class GraphqlController < ActionController::API
  
  include Graphql::AuthHelper
  
  def execute
    variables = ensure_hash(params[:variables])
    query = params[:query]
    operation_name = params[:operationName]
    result = ::GraphqlSchema.execute(query, variables: variables, context: context, operation_name: operation_name)
    render json: result
    
    ...
```

Make sure to implement `GraphqlAuth` in your `MutationType` to make auth mutations available

```
class Types::MutationType < Types::BaseObject
  implements ::Types::GraphqlAuth
end
```

## Customization

If you can to customize any mutation, make sure to update the configurations

```
GraphQL::Auth.configure do |config|
  # config.token_lifespan = 4.hours
  # config.jwt_secret_key = ENV['JWT_SECRET_KEY']
  # config.app_url = ENV['APP_URL']

  config.sign_in_mutation = ::Mutations::CustomSignIn
  
  ...

```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `graphql-auth.gemspec`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
